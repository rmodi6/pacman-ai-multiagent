# pacman-ai-multiagent
This repository contains solutions to the Pacman AI Multi-Agent Search problems. The multiagent problem requires modeling an adversarial and a stochastic search agent using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.
